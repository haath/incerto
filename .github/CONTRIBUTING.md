# Guidelines for Pull Requests

1. Do not submit code generated by LLMs, Copilots or other AI assistants.
2. Do not add new examples. You may be asked to do it if your new feature calls for one.
3. A review won't start if the CI doesn't pass. So fix any errors you see.
4. Expect that your code will be reviewed and that there will be many comments. It's a normal thing and standard practice. Abandoning the PR without addressing review comments is rude to those who spent time reviewing it..
