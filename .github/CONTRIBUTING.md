# Guidelines for Pull Requests

1. Please do not submit code generated by LLMs, Copilots or other AI assistants. It's a mess to review and tends to degrade a codebase over time.
2. Do not add new examples. You may be asked to do it if your new feature calls for one.
3. A review won't start if the CI doesn't pass. So fix any errors you see.
4. Expect that your code will be reviewed and that there will be many comments. It's a normal thing and standard practice. Abandoning the PR without addressing review comments is rude to those who spent time reviewing it..
